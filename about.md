## About Me

Hi, I’m Rebecca Byrnes. I work at the intersection of climate policy, data, and communication. I enjoy building clear, engaging tools and content that help people understand complex systems.

Areas of focus:

- Policy and research translation into visuals and stories
- Data analysis and interactive dashboards
- Writing and speaking on climate and markets

If you’d like a longer bio or a headshot added here, I can incorporate that and link to a PDF resume.
