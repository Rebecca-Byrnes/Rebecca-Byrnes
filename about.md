## About Me

Hi, I’m Rebecca Byrnes — a cybersecurity and information security compliance professional based in Portugal. I help organizations design, implement, and mature security programs that are practical, auditable, and aligned to business goals.

Focus areas:

- ISO/IEC 27001 implementation and internal audits
- SOC 2 readiness, control design, and evidence collection
- Risk management aligned to ISO 27005 and NIST
- Secure SDLC enablement and developer-friendly controls
- Policy frameworks, procedures, and security awareness

Selected outcomes:

- Led ISO 27001 certification projects from gap analysis to successful external audit
- Built SOC 2 control libraries with automated evidence capture for CI/CD and cloud
- Launched third‑party risk management and vendor due diligence workflows
- Drove phishing-resilience and security awareness programs with measurable uplift

I’m originally from [your origin if desired], now living in Portugal. Outside work, I enjoy exploring the Atlantic coast and learning Portuguese.

If you’d like a detailed resume or references, feel free to reach out.
